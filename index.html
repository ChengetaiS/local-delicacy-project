          <h2>Food in Zimbabwe</h2>
          <h3>Gastronomy</h3>
          <p>
            What to eat in Zimbabwe? From worms to chicken stew, peanut butter,
            and cornbread. The variety of flavors and textures is surprising. As
            in almost all African countries, Zimbabwe's cuisine is characterized
            by its intense and well-defined flavors thanks to the use of spices
            and herbs in most of the recipes they prepare. This country has a
            very rich and tasty culinary culture whose dishes stand out, in
            addition to their flavor, also for the ease of their preparation.
            The trick is to use high-quality raw materials.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meat products of all kinds predominate in the diet of the people of
            Zimbabwe. Chicken, pig, cow, goat, and sheep are used to cook
            different types of stews which are accompanied by various
            ingredients of vegetables and cereals. The simplest version of these
            dishes is preparing them fried or grilled. Another main ingredient
            in the diet of the Zimbabwean people is fish. Especially freshwater
            fish. Usually, they are cooked on the grill and eaten with rice or
            corn. Sometimes they are also prepared with different types of
            vegetables, both cooked and raw. Another of the most striking
            features of the cuisine of this country is the result of a balanced
            combination of British and traditional Zimbabwean cuisine.
            Vegetarian travelers will find a variety of sub-tropical products
            and very high-quality options.
